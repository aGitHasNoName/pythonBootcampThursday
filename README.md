# Python Fundamentals Bootcamp Thursday

Thursday's lecture is a demo of interactive coding and a lesson on writing and running Python scripts. [acre_script.py](https://github.com/aGitHasNoName/pythonBootcampThursday/blob/master/acre_script.py) is a sample Python script used in the lecture. This lecture is not taught in Jupyter notebooks, however, you can complete the Thursday homework assignment (described in [thursdayHW.txt](https://github.com/aGitHasNoName/pythonBootcampThursday/blob/master/thursdayHW.txt)) in a new Jupyter Notebook without watching the lecture.
